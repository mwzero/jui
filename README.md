# Welcome to JUI
JUI is a lightweight framework for creating interactive web applications directly in Java with few simple commands.

Inspired by [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) and [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium).

JUI allows developers to create rich and dynamic user interfaces in just a few simple steps. With JUI, you can quickly turn your Java "scripts" into full-featured web applications without having to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

Jui comes with a built-in HTTP server to run and serve applications.
