# Introduction

*JUI* is a Java toolkit designed to build and share web applications in pure Java, without requiring frontend development experience.  

Inspired by streamlit, gradio and folium. 

It includes a simple HTTP/HTTPS/WSS server and a playground to try out its features.

# Key Features:
- Backend Development in Java: Build web applications using only Java.
- Integrated Server: Includes a simple HTTP/HTTPS/WSS server to handle requests.
- Playground: An interactive environment to test and experiment with the framework's features.

Please see the [getting started](getting-started.md).

# Playground application
